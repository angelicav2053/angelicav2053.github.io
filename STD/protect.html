<h1> Awesome Prevention Tools </h1>
<p class="text"> These are tools that a person who is sexually active can use to protect themselves and make sure they participate in safe sex. </p>
<h3> Condoms </h3>   <img src="cond.jpg" class="cond" width="400" length="400"> </img>
<p class="how"> Condoms are a form of male protection that is effective against both condoms and most STDs. To correctly use a condom, first check the package and see if the condoms are expired. If the condom is expired, the rubber will become brittle and far more likely to break. After you’ve checked for the expiration date, make sure the  condom is free of tears or holes. Once you find a whole, fresh condom, take a couple drops of water based lube and spread it on the whole penis. Take the condom and insert the head of the penis inside the condom, then squeeze the top of the condom to remove any air in the condom (if the male is uncircumcised pull back the foreskin). After the head has been inserted, roll the condom the rest of the way down the shaft. Apply more of the water-based lube, and have sex.  After sex, but before pulling out, hold the base of the condom and then pull out (while still holding the base). Take off the condom and dispose of it. </p>
<h4> Warnings!!!! </h4>
<p class="how">  This is for latex condoms. Latex reacts badly when both friction and oil is present, cause rips in the condoms. For safe sex apply water-based lube inside and outside of the condom. Condoms do not protect against all STDs, and are not 100% effective. Condoms should be used during oral sex with a penis, as well as any sort of penetrative sex. To help ensure safety during sex, make sure you buy the correct sized condoms. </p>
<h3> Dental Dam </h3>    <img src="dental.jpg" class="dental" width="400" length="400"> </img>
<p class="how"> Dental dams are squares of latex that do over the vaginal opening or anus. This is to protect users during oral intercoarse by blocking direct contact with skin or liquids from the anus or vagina. There are two ways to use a latex dental dam. The first way is to buy latex dental dams, and, before use, people need to check the expiration date of the dams as well as look for any holes. Water-based lubes should be placed on the vagina or anus before the dam is placed to cover either the entire anus or the whole vagina (including the labia majora. Put some water-based lube on the outside of the dental dam. After you’re finished, dispose of the dam. The second way is to take a condom and cut off of the tip of the condom, then make a cut up from one of the openings of the condom to make a square. This square can be used as a dental dam, and should be treated the same as a dental dam.
</p>
<h4> Warnings!!!! </h4>

<p class="how"> This is for latex dental dams. Latex reacts badly when both friction and oil is present, cause rips in the dam. For safe sex apply water-based lube on both sides of the dam. Dental dams do not protect against all STDs, and are not 100% effective. </p>
<h3> Cervical Cap </h3> <img src="cap.jpeg" class="cap" width="400" length="400"> </img>
<p class="how"> A cervical cap is a silicone cup that's inserted into the vagina up to six hours before sex to prevent pregnancy. To work effectively, it needs to be used with spermicide.Prescription needed.
71-86% effective with typical use. Insert up to 6 hours prior to sex. </p>
<h4> Warnings!!!!</h4>
<p class="how"> Side effects include acne, headaches, weight, menstrual changes, also possible. It is typically 71-86% effective, and requires a prescription. </p>
