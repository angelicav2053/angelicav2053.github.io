<p class="about"> Izzie Kirby: </p>         <img src="izzie.jpg" class="pics" length="150" width="150"> </img>
<p class="bio"> Aside from basic reproductive knowledge, like what a cervix is along with other anatomical junk, I have next to no knowledge of how protect myself from STDs. I honestly think that it's ridiculous that people think abstinence only education is a viable option, as it only allows for people to know how to have unsafe sex and I want to contribute to the solving of this problem.
I like socializing, playing video games, and coding! I attend Irma Rangel Young Women's Leadership School and am a rising senior. I am a girl who codes.

<p class="about"> Angelica Vega: </p> <img src="me.jpeg" class="pics" length="200" width="200"> </img>
<p class="bio"> I'm 17 and have only been educated about sexual diseases once. I saw this as a problem and came up with the idea for this website in hopes to educated my fellow classmates as long as everyone else. Other than that I am a big fan of conspiracy theories, superheroes, and vines.
My favorite food is rice and I love hanging out with my family. I'm a rising senior at Irma Rangel who is excited to become a college student and I am a girl who codes.  </p>

<p class="about"> Daniela Portillo: </p>      <img src="dani.png" class="pics" length="200" width="200"> </img>
<p class="bio"> In my whole  seventeen years I have grown up in a state that enforces an abstinence-based health curriculum. Just like me, I am sure there are others with little to no safe-sex education.This page serves to not only inform others, but myself as well.
I am a rising senior that attends Irma Rangel Young Women's School. I am a girl who codes.</p>
